# TwitterBot
A series of automation scipts written in Python by [Michael Sterpka](https://github.com/michaelsterpka).
* <b>Follow</b> - Allows for the following of a specific set of users. This set is generated by selecting a single user and fetching his or her followers. 
* <b>Unfollow</b> - Allows for the unfollowing of already followed users. 
  * `Stable Mode:` Implements a random sleep timer in order to reduce the chance of a `RateLimitError`.
  * `Skip Mutual Followers:` Only unfollows users who are <b>not</b> following you back. 

###Notice
Rapid following and unfollowing of users is against [Twitter's Terms of Service](https://twitter.com/tos?lang=en) and may result in either an account closure or suspension. Please be weary when spam (un)following. By using this application, you aknowledge that all responsibility falls on the user.

###Libraries
A few public libraries were used to make this project possible. Thank you to the following:
* [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org/), an open-source Python library built for accessing the Twitter API.
* [PyQt5](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/index.html), a GPL licensed Python binding for the Qt application framework
